# Stock Data Visualization
**IT4320 Software Engineering — Project 3**

---

## What It Does

This Python application lets a user look up historical stock data for any publicly traded company using the Alpha Vantage API. The user selects a stock symbol, a chart type, a time series interval, and a custom date range. The app then fetches the data and automatically opens an interactive chart in the user's default web browser.

---

## Setup

**1. Get a free API key**
Go to https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key and sign up for a free key.

**2. Add your API key**
Open `config.py` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key:
```python
API_KEY = "your_key_goes_here"
```

**3. Install dependencies** (one time only)
Open a terminal inside the project folder and run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the application**
```
python main.py
```

## How to Use It

Once running, the app will walk you through five prompts in order:

| Prompt | Example Input |
|---|---|
| Stock symbol | `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `GOOGL` |
| Chart type | `1` for Bar, `2` for Line |
| Time series | `1` Daily, `2` Weekly, `3` Monthly |
| Beginning date | `2022-01-01` |
| End date | `2023-01-01` |

After the last prompt, the app fetches the data and opens your chart in the browser. The chart is also saved as `SYMBOL_chart.html` in the project folder so you can reopen it anytime.

## How Each Module Fulfills a Project Task

**Task 1 — `task1_stock_symbol.py`**
Asks the user to enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g. AAPL). Validates that the input is non-empty and contains only letters before passing it along.

**Task 2 — `task2_chart_type.py`**
Presents the user with a numbered menu of chart types (Bar or Line) and returns their selection. Keeps prompting if an invalid option is entered.

**Task 3 — `task3_time_series.py`**
Presents the user with a numbered menu of Alpha Vantage time series functions (Daily, Weekly, Monthly). Returns both the API function name and the corresponding JSON key needed to parse the response.

**Task 4 — `task4_begin_date.py`**
Asks the user for a beginning date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Validates the format using Python's `datetime` module and keeps prompting until a valid date is entered.

**Task 5 — `task5_end_date.py`**
Asks the user for an end date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. In addition to format validation, it checks that the end date is not before the beginning date, re-prompting the user if it is.

**Task 6 — `task6_visualizer.py`**
Handles two things: first, it calls the Alpha Vantage API using the `requests` library and retrieves up to 20 years of stock data. Then it filters that data to the user's selected date range, builds an interactive chart using `plotly`, saves it as an HTML file, and opens it automatically in the user's default web browser.

---

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `requests` | Makes HTTP calls to the Alpha Vantage API |
| `plotly` | Generates interactive charts saved as HTML |

---

## Notes

- The free Alpha Vantage API tier allows 25 requests per day. If you hit the limit, wait until the next day or sign up for a paid key.
- The generated chart file (`SYMBOL_chart.html`) is saved in the same folder as `main.py` and will be overwritten each time you run the app with the same symbol.
